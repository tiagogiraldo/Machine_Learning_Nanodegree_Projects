# Machine_Learning_Nanodegree_Projects
This repository contains projects made to obtain the Udacity nanodegree certificate. There are four projects corresponding to each of the modules studied during the course:

- Predicting Boston Housing Prices.
- Building a Student Intervention System.
- Creating Customer Segments
- Train a Smartcab to Drive

The Capstone project is an ML application to a health care field. I choose a illness from MIMIC III database and made some ML analysis about this. The pneumonia can be fatal in some cases. The hypothesis is that one can predict the death probability of said disease by analyzing microbiological variables coming from tests.  This leads us to a problem that can be represented binarily, and that can be related to physicochemical variables obtained from microbiological tests. These relationships allow the modeling of the pneumonia death problem by means of a supervised learning model such as the Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Ada Boost ensemble.
